0. give user field/centos etc sudo

1. Make sure dns is set via NetworkManager

nmcli 
(that will show the connections)

then
e.g. for eno1
nmcli con mod eno1 ipv4.dns "192.168.11.1"

2. Set up ssh-key and distribute to the other root hosts

3. Install docker first so we can set up the storage:


yum -y install docker-1.13.1




To use an existing, specified volume group:

    In /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup, set VG to the volume group. For example:

    # cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
    VG=docker-vg
    EOF

    Then run docker-storage-setup and review the output to ensure the docker-pool volume was created:

    # docker-storage-setup
      Rounding up size to full physical extent 16.00 MiB
      Logical volume "docker-poolmeta" created.
      Logical volume "docker-pool" created.
      WARNING: Converting logical volume docker-vg/docker-pool and docker-vg/docker-poolmeta to pool's data and metadata volumes.
      THIS WILL DESTROY CONTENT OF LOGICAL VOLUME (filesystem etc.)
      Converted docker-vg/docker-pool to thin pool.
      Logical volume "docker-pool" changed.
